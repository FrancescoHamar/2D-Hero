# 2D-Hero (2019-2020)

## Project info:
This project was done with the sole purpose of learning c#. No revenue was obtained from this code.

Hidden (not committed) library used:
  - Bayat Games: Most of the sprites have not been designed and made by me. My focus was almost entirely on the code and the functional part of the game.
  - TextMesh Pro: Similarly some of the text texture used is not made by me.

## Some Details:
The main focus of the game was the functionality of the game. However, some thought went into the design and animation of the menus and the gameplay.

The menus have a simple but intuitive look:

The game is set on three themes, with different levels (spring, autumn, winter). The player has to walk through a very simple map with door to each level in a particular theme.

Finally, the gameplay is played with three simple buttons, made to be comfortable on a mobile phone. The player has to avoid obstacles such as spikes and pits, all while collecting money that can be used in the shop (buy options not yet implemented).
